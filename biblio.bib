  Abstract                 = {The concepts of information flow security and refinement are known to have had a troubled relationship ever since the seminal work of McLean. In this work we study refinements that support changes in data representation, including the addition of state variables that may induce new observational power or side channels. We propose a new epistemic approach to confidentiality-preserving refinement where an abstract model  is used as a specification of a systemâ€™s permitted information flows, that may include the declassification of secret information. The core idea is to require that refinement steps must not induce observer knowledge that is not available in the abstract model. When verifying complex systems, a basic problem is that confidentiality-preserving refinement is not horizontally composable, since sequentially composed refinement instances may violate confidentiality preservation. To overcome this issue, we employ a sound overapproximation that does allow horizontal composition and enables the verification to go through, thanks to a novel unwinding condition, refined noninterference, developed in the paper. We demonstrate the resulting verification framework on a multi-process system with flat memory and no timing information that is refined by a model hardware equipped with a cache and a set of local clocks, exhibiting insecure cache timing channels. We show that with proper countermeasures in place, for instance a combination of cache coloring and constant time execution, the resulting refined model is a confidentiality-preserving refinement of the abstract specification.}

  Abstract                 = {Spatial and temporal memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors are a never-ending source of exploits and attacks against otherwise benign programs. They enable attackers to overwrite control-flow relevant data (e.g. the target location of indirect jump instructions) that are spatially or temporally located in close proximity to related user-controlled data, and thereby to subvert the control flow of the victim program. 

Established defenses either seek to mitigate the impact of these attacks by restricting the range of possible targets or attempt to hide necessary information from the attacker. None of these defenses, however, tackle the underlying problem: instructions in a program can write to memory sections they should not be able to write at the point in time when they are executed.

In this paper, we propose PROCONDA, a general approach for protecting control-flow relevant data. PROCONDA introduces and leverages the Write Instruction Origin (WIO) to determine which code location should have write access to a certain memory location.}

  Abstract                 = {We present a compiler-based scheme for protecting the confidentiality of sensitive data in low-level applications (e.g. those written in C) in the presence of an active adversary. In  our scheme, the programmer marks sensitive data by writing lightweight annotations on the top-level definitions in the source code. The compiler then uses a combination of static dataflow analysis and runtime instrumentation to prevent data leaks even in the presence of low-level attacks. To reduce runtime overheads, the compiler uses a novel memory layout and a taint-aware form of control flow integrity. We formalize our scheme and prove its security. We have also implemented our scheme within the LLVM compiler and  evaluated it on the CPU-intensive SPEC micro-benchmarks, and on larger, real-world applications, including the NGINX webserver and the OpenLDAP directory server. We find that performance overheads introduced by our instrumentation are moderate (average 12% on SPEC), and the programmer effort to port the applications is minimal.}

  Abstract                 = {Caches pose a significant challenge to formal proofs of security for code executing on application processors, as the cache access pattern of security-critical services may leak secret information. This paper reveals a novel attack vector, exposing a low-noise cache storage channel that can be exploited by adapting well-known timing channel analysis techniques. The vector can also be used to attack various types of security-critical software such as hypervisors and application security monitors. The attack vector uses virtual aliases with mismatched memory attributes and self-modifying code to misconfigure the memory system, allowing an attacker to place incoherent copies of the same physical address into the caches and observe which addresses are stored in different levels of cache. We design and implement three different attacks using the new vector on trusted services and report on the discovery of an 128-bit key from an AES encryption service running in TrustZone on Raspberry Pi2. Moreover, we subvert the integrity properties of an ARMv7 hypervisor that was formally verified against a cache-less model. We evaluate well-known countermeasures against the new attack vector and propose a verification methodology that allows to formally prove the effectiveness of defence mechanisms on the binary code of the trusted software.}
