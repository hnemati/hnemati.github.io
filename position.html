		<p> Modern computing devices involve a wealth of features like hardware caches and speculative execution that, while invisible to system-software executing on the platform, can affect their behavior in many aspects. Designing a system-software that can securely interact with the underlying hardware and fully exploit its capabilities is a challenging task within the computer security. This is the goal we set ourselves in this project. Our approach is to combine system-level solutions with rigorous analysis techniques to identify vulnerabilities and develop countermeasures and prototypes with provable security guarantees.</p>

		<p>Applicants must hold or be about to receive a master degree in Computer Science (or equivalent, some exceptions can be made for exceptional Bachelor students). A strong background in computer science in general, and some previous exposure to formal methods and system software security is essential for these positions. Pluses are previous experience with the use or development of verification tools, as well as familiarity with internal structure of modern operating systems and processing hardware.</p>
		<p> The application should contain the following:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li> CV including relevant professional experience and knowledge.</li>
		  <li> Brief explanation of why you want to conduct research, about your academic interests and how they relate to your previous studies and future goals; max 2 pages long.</li>
		  <li> Copies of diplomas and grades from your previous university studies. Translations to  English or German if the original documents are not issued in one of these languages.</li>
		  <li> Representative publications or technical reports: Document no more than 10 pages each. For longer documents (eg dissertations), attach a summary (abstract) and a web link to the full text.</li>
		  <li> One recommendation letter</li>
		  <li> Contact information for two reference persons. We reserve the right to contact references only for selected candidates.</li>
