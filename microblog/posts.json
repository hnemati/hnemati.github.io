    {"text": "If you are into microarchitectural attacks, check out our recent arXiv paper. To summarize, we show that the devil is in the 'micro' details!\n We analyzed the microcode of Intel processors and showed the root cause of many Spectre attacks. We found out that some of the known variants are indeed misclassified.\n\n More details and experiments on other x86 processors are hopefully coming soon in the paper's conference version: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12890", "image": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQFzzpidmjXQ9Q/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZSSZnPGG8As-/0/1737622976118?e=1741824000&v=beta&t=vwV_e3gI_2bHg7gYOVw0k4vzDII8SRT_OHv1zLIyHjM", "timestamp": "2025-01-26T10:00:00Z"}
